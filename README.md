# CIS22C-Team6

All Files for the Team Project will be in the Team Project Folder BEFORE the Week 1
section in Catalyst
Background
As a team of 2 to 4 programmers (in a team assigned by the instructor), you will
solve a problem using the Graph template classes given on Catalyst. Your team will
choose the problem from a given set of problems (to be posted during Week 8 in
Catalyst) OR choose your own (with approval from the instructor), AND the data to
be stored in the graph (details given later). These details will be a separate Team
Project Requirements document posted by Week 8.
During Week 11, you will participate in your team's presentation of your project as
assigned by your instructor (we'll use CCCConfer, but you must meet in the place
and time designated). Between now and your presentation, there will be 3 reports
due (see separate links to be posted in Weeks 7, 8 and 10).

Your Team Projects will be graded as follows:
1. Completeness: 20 pts
2. Accuracy/Correctness/Efficiency: 15 pts
3. Documentation: 10 pts
4. Presentation: 5 points
